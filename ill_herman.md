# HERMANS GRID
## What do yo see?
![Herman's Grid](illASSETS/hermans_grid_illusion.png)
Here is an illusory image known as Herman's grid. It is a regularly spaced array of dark squares seperated by vertical and horizontal strips of white lines. You should notice grey dots or smudges at the intersections of thse white line. Here we will discuss why we see them.

## The Classical Theory
### **Foundations**
Lets go over some details about some of visual neurons that tile the back of your eye. 

There are neurons in youre eye known as **center surround** retinal ganglion cells. We'll refer to them as **CS**  cells for brevity. CS neurons are invoked to explain the little gray blobs we see when viewing hermans grid. 

There are many properties of CS cells that one must remember to understand the (many) proposed hypothesis that underlie this illusion. Here are a few

- CS cells have a *location preference*: For example, a CS cell will activate in response to a stimulus that appears in a particular region of visual space. 
  - The the further that stimulus is from that preffered location the less the CS cell will activate.
- CS cells are *tuned to size*: This means that CS cells activate only when a stimulus covers the central portion its spatial receptive field (see figure).  
  - As more 'lightness' appears in surrounding region of its receptive field, the cell's activity progressively decreases as well.
- CS cells are *NOT tuned orientation*. If an elongated bar lands on receptive field it, it will activate in a similar manner when the bar is vertical, horizontal, diagonal, etc. 
    - That is, the response of the cell does not depend on the orientation of a stimulus.

### **The Classical Model**...
Now lets discuss the most classical of all hypothesis about why we perceive those gray blobs on hermans grid. The idea is that the blobs are caused by the relatively weak activity of CS cells that are stimulated by tge intersecting regions of the image.  

Lets go over how this would work...
* First, consider how  a CS would respond if the intersecting regions of the grid lands on its receptive field. The cell would weakly activate, because the grid's intersection provides too much 'lightness' in the surrounding region of the cells receptive field. 
* How would the cell respond if it were stimulated by the non-intersecting regions of the grid? This region provides CS cells with a slightly more 'preferred' stimulus than the intersection does. There is less lightness (or conversly, more 'darkness') in the surround, which is something the cell 'likes'. 
* Therefore, when viewing the grid, there is a set of CS that are weakly stimulated by the intersection, these cells are not as active. Another set of CS cekks are strongly stimulated by the non-intersection regions of the grid - and are much more active. This imbalance of activity, or the weak CS responses at the intersections, generate those illusory gray blobs.

## Limitations and Alternative Ideas
The theory is simple but perhaps too simple. Lets go over two reasons why the theory fails.
![Excercise for Herman's Grid](illASSETS/herman_grid_excercise_var_graph_results.png)

### Problem1: The illusion is perceived over a large range of sizes
**Prediction** 
The classical model predicts that the illusion should only occur when the grid is a specific size, i.e. when the intersecting regions perfectly 'fit on top' of the receptive fields of CS cells. If the intersecting regions are too large such that they extent beyond the CS cells receptive fields, the illusion should go away. 

Can you think about what would happen when the grid is too small?

**Reasoning**
This prediction is based on the idea that retinal receptors, ganglion cells, and their receptive fields have fixed sizes. 

**Testing**
We can test this hypothesis by varying the size of the grid which would change the extent to which the receptive fields of CS cells are covered. But contrary to the model's prediction, the illusory blobs are always perceived regardless of the size of the grid ([reference]()). 

**Alternative Explanation**
To account for the 'size invariance' of the illusion, the model must be elaborated.

One idea is that different brain regions and cells, in addition to retinal ganglion cells generate the illusion (Wolfe, 1984; Spillman, 1994; Schiller and Carvey, 2005). For example, retinal CS cells send their outputs to cells in area V1, in turn have larger  fields than retinal CS cells. ([reference]())

**Homework**
* Draw a figure of different sized grids and how they  project and cover the receptive fields of CS cells.  
* Describe what the classical theory expects to happen to CS cells under these two situations

### Problem 2: The illusion is affected by rotating the grid 
**Prediction**
Now to another failure of the classical model. The classical model predicts that the illusion should persist even when the grid is rotated.

**Reasoning**
This prediction is grounded on the fact that the receptive fields of CS cells are circular. When receptive fields are circular, they are insensitive to the orientation of a stimulus, even if that stimulus fits perfectly on top of the receptive field.

**Testing**
We can easily test this hypothesis by varying the orientation of the grid. But contrary to the model's prediction, the illusion weakens as the grid is rotated ([Schiller and Carvey, 2005]())
 
**Alternative Explanation**
To explain for the rotation effect of the illusion, one can invoke the orientation tuned cells in V1 ([Hubel and Wiesel, 1968]()). In V1, there tends to be more cells tuned to cardinal orientations (ie horizontal and vertical) vs oblique ones([ref]()). Furthermore, human acuity and contrast sensitivity is smaller for objects that are at an oblique angle ([Appelle, 1972; Westheimer, 2003](). 

**Homework**
* Draw a figure of grids orientated at different angles and how the grid would project onto the receptive field of CS cells.
* Describe what the classical theory expects to happen to center surround cells under these situations

**Bonus Homework**
* Can you think of another prediction that the classical model would make? How could you test this?
