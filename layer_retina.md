# Sensory Units
The back of the eye - known as the retina - contains a multitude of cell types. Here we will focus on a specific type of retinal cell, known as **center surround** retinal ganglion cells (we'll refer to them as **CS** cells for brevity). 

## Center Surround Cells
CS cells exhibit some interesting properties.

Perhaps the most obvious property of CS cells is that they have *spatial receptive fields*. A cell with a well defined receptive field is *tuned to the location* of a stimulus. This means it will respond when a visual stimulus appears in a particular region of the eye. The further that stimulus deviates from that location the weaker the activation of the CS cell. In this sense, the CS cell is said to *prefer* the location of a stimulus. Typically, the CS cell's preffered location is the same as the position that is cell body is in the retina.

CS cells are also *tuned to contrast polarity*. Some CS cells will respond to 'light' spots, while others will respond to 'dark' spots. However, the spot needs to be a particular size: not too large, not too small, but instead must covers the central portion of the cells spatial receptive field. As the spot extends more and more into surrounding region of the cell's receptive field, its activity progressively decreases. In this sense CS cells are also *tuned to the size* of the stimulus.
