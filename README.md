#### About
Many of the notes and presentation here are about visual illusions. They were originally designed to guide inner-city kids visiting UCLA. It was all about fun presentations and illusions with accompanying neuroscientific explanations. It was supported multiple members of the [SACNAS organization at UCLA](http://www.sacnasatucla.com/) 

The course was later the course was adapted for more advanced highschool and undergraduate students [Lumiere education](https://www.lumiere-education.com/).
