# A course on Biological and Machine Vision
![test](bmcASSETS/perceptron_vs_neuron.png)
This repo contains teaching material about machine vision, machine learning, and their relationship with the human visual system. Students can explore the neuroscience of vision through visual illusions, activation functions, neural nets through various presentations, readings, and programming assignments.

# About
Many of the notes and presentation here are about visual illusions. They were originally designed to guide inner-city kids visiting UCLA. It was all about fun presentations and illusions with accompanying neuroscientific explanations. It was supported multiple members of the [SACNAS organization at UCLA](http://www.sacnasatucla.com/) 

The course was later the course was adapted for more advanced highschool and undergraduate students [Lumiere education](https://www.lumiere-education.com/).
